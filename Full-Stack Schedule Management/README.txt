This project is a work in progress. Parts of the front end still needs some updating
and I am working towards additional features such as events based on accounts, ability to login with any account

The front-end for admin.html along with a very basic outline for schedule.html was given from Dan Challou's CSCI 4131 course at the University of Minnesota
The entire backend and scripts written in the html files were written by myself.
