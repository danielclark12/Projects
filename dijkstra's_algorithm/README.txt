This project implemented Dijkstra's algorithm on an adjacency matrix to find the shortest
path from a starting node to a destination node. The data is read in from an input file
where the first line follows the pattern of "starting node, destination node" and the lines that follow is
the adjacency matrix.

The output is placed into and output.txt file with the first number being the distance traveled, and the following
is the path that it took.
