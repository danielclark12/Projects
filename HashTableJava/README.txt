This project implements a couple different hash functions to hash various words from different files. 
Both open-addressing and the division method are implemented in this project. For the division method I took the sum
of all the ASCII characters in the string and used the formula sum % tableLength to come up with an index. 
A linked list data structure was also used to create chains that would deal with any collisions that may occur.
